//! This example implements a small command line application that
//! allows key generation, message encryption, and ciphertext decryption
//! using the Latin Shift Cipher.
//!
//! This example does not really satisfy the desired criterion for an
//! example, in that it does not really showcase "proper" usage of the crate.
//! It does highlight where the provided library API fails a basic use case, though:
//! we have to use the `Debug` impl to print `Key` values to sdout because I couldn't decide
//! how the library ought to handle keys.
